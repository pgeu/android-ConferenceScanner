Privacy Policy
==============

This page serves as a privacy policy for the Google Play store entry
for this app.

The app itself collects no information beyond the registration of
which conferences it's registered to talk to.

No analytics of app usage are collected, beyond those collected by the
Play Store outside our control and subject to the Google privacy
policy (which may include crash dumps). The app does not and will not
contain ads of any form.

Camera permissions are used to temporarily scan the camera input in
order to identify barcodes. Barcodes are identified locally on the
device using the Google ML Kit barcode APIs. Barcode identification
happens [on the
device](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ml-kit/read-barcodes), no
photographic data is transmitted across the network.

The contents of scanned barcodes will be transmitted to the server of
the registered conference. At the server they are likely logged and
possibly analyzed, specific to the privacy policy of the individual
conference instance. Beyond the barcode itself, the only data stored
server side is the free-text note written when scanning a badge.
